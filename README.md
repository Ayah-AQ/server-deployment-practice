> ## Notes

```
1- TDD (Test-Driven Development) is an approach where tests are written before the code. The code is then developed and refined until all the tests pass.

2- CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment) automate testing for code changes or application updates. GitHub Actions enables automated testing. Locally, the npm test command verifies that all tests pass before pushing the changes.

3- Middleware functions are regular functions used in applications. You can have multiple middleware functions for different application needs. They can be exported using module.exports for use throughout the codebase.
